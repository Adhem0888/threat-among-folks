<p><b>Edited last 23/5/2555</b>: Hello all who may be reading this. I am <i>Tm9haCBIaWxs</i>, Senior Communications Officer for the United Sky Republic. I have compiled this short document for you.</p>

<p>The wasteland definitely isn't "safe", but besides the abominations and beasts crawling the Earth, I am here to warn you of a threat crawling among the common folk.</p>
<p>I apologize if *some* words in the documents are incorrect, I did not write it and I tried to correct as many inconsistencies as I saw.</p> 
<p>I had gone through reports on my computer quite awhile ago, and I have had information about threats revealed to me that worries me and should worry you on the ground. Or at least, I assume you are on the ground if you don't know what I am referring to.</p>
<p>Direct text from the documents will be in white, corrections will be in <span style=color:cyan>blue</span> to avoid any confusion.</p>

	<p style=color:brown>"You have to look at this. We're dealing with fucking demons, savage beasts mutated by the destruction they saught. They've learned to prolong their lives into something that is no longer human - four fucking centuries to hone their demonic and ruin-inducing crafts. Don't try to go after them, we've lost too many to hubris. Just stay alert, okay? I sent you a summary of the briefing. It's too important not to."</p>
	<p>CLASSIFIED EMERGENCY BRIEF</p>
	<p>SUBJECT: Threat Assessment - Echoes</p>
	<p>I. Appearance. Echoes are identifiable by severe burn damage across their bodies, with limbs appearing as dark as soot. A persistent odor of charred flesh often accompanies them. All suspicious individuals must be instructed to fully reveal their limbs before being permitted entry into private or secure areas. Failure to enforce this protocol could lead to significant risk.</p>
	<p>II. Behavioral Patterns. Echoes exhibit unstable and erratic behavior, often resembling the psychological aftermath of warfare. Indicators include: Unusually wide eyes, suggesting hypervigilance or shock. Behavioral instability, including sudden outbursts of rage, twitching, snarling, or teeth grinding. Predatory tendencies; Echoes are known to exhibit animalistic behavior and will not hesitate to pursue perceived threats. Exercise extreme caution when interacting with individuals displaying unnatural or aggressive habits.</p>
	<p>III. Known Abilities. Echoes possess supernatural capabilities that render them highly dangerous. Observed abilities include but are not limited to: Pyromancy – Manipulation of fire for offensive purposes. Bone Reconfiguration – Utilizing their own skeletal structure as a weapon. Regeneration – Have torn apart their limbs for it to grow back, typical while getting rid of bullet wounds. It is critical to assume all Echoes are capable of lethality, regardless of their specific abilities.</p>
	<p>IV. Omniscience and Knowledge. Echoes possess extensive knowledge of the old world—a world they played a role in destroying. This knowledge is of immense value, making them targets for exploitation by hostile factions, such as the Brotherhood. Be wary of any individual displaying an unusual degree of confidence or claiming comprehensive knowledge of pre-cataclysmic events.</p>
	<p>V. Operational Guidance. Echoes are not to be trusted under any circumstances. Historical accounts suggest they were trained in manipulation and psychological warfare, including tactics in direct violation of the old-world Geneva Conventions. Echoes are adept at exploiting vulnerabilities, often feigning harmlessness to strike when least expected. <span style=color:cyan>(They wont strike if you just walk away... You have no reason to be fighting them if you didn't start it.)</span></p>
	<p>Personnel are advised to:</p> 

	<p>Avoid unnecessary engagement.
	<p>Maintain a defensive posture when encountering suspected Echoes.</p> 
	<p>Report all sightings or interactions to Command immediately.</p>

	<p>Comment by Editor of document - 6:35.</p>
	<p style=color:brown>"Jesus, this shit is a mess. Being human ain't easy. Living with the consequences of our ancestors' actions is a heavy burden. But obviously these bastards can't help but cling onto denial. Dunno how, but they've got some rusty chip in their brain, so they can manipulate our security systems to strike at us. Take a look, it might help you when you deploy your sqauds."</p>
	<p>CLASSIFIED SECURITY BRIEF</p>
	<p>SUBJECT: Threat Assessment - Rebel Faction "Technocrats"</p>
	<p>I. Appearance. The Technocrats, often referred to as "gearheads," are known for their extensive use of mechanical modifications and implants. These individuals frequently display their enhancements openly, treating them as symbols of status and superiority. Exercise caution around individuals with concealed or obscured limbs, as such coverings may hide dangerous augmentations. All personnel are advised to avoid compromising positions without conducting a thorough inspection of suspicious individuals.</p>
	<p>II. Behavioral Patterns. Technocrats exhibit distinct behavioral traits that can aid in their identification: Movement: Mechanical augmentations may result in stiff or jerky movements, or unnatural joint articulation. Awareness: Enhanced vision systems may cause their eyes to track movement with unnerving precision. Demeanor: A tendency toward emotional detachment, marked by apathy or sudden, unprovoked aggression. These behaviors suggest a diminishing connection to their human origins, replaced by a reliance on their mechanical augmentations. <span style=color:cyan>(Incorrect, their mental states remain intact)</span></p>
	<p>III. Known Abilities. Technocrats are highly dangerous combatants, leveraging their mechanical enhancements to dominate in conflict. Known capabilities include: Enhanced Physical Attributes – Augmented speed, strength, and endurance, far exceeding human limitations. Integrated Weaponry – The potential for hidden, cybernetic weapon systems. Combat Resilience – Enhanced durability, allowing them to sustain significant damage without incapacitation. Expect Technocrats to engage aggressively, often initiating conflict to demonstrate their superiority. Their unpredictability and resourcefulness make them formidable adversaries.</p>
	<p>IV. Tactical Knowledge. Formerly affiliated with the Brotherhood, the Technocrats possess advanced training in old-world military tactics and strategies. Their understanding of warfare is extensive, making them far more than simple raiders. They draw upon historical combat methods and adapt them with their technological innovations.</p>
	<p>V. Strategic Advantage. The Technocrats are supported by advanced Artificial Intelligence systems, providing them with unparalleled strategic and operational capabilities. This integration of human ingenuity and technological augmentation has created a faction that is both intellectually and physically superior in many respects. Their motivations, while rooted in rebellion, are driven by a calculated and relentless pursuit of their objectives.</p>
	<p>Operational Guidance. Personnel are advised to: Maintain heightened vigilance when engaging with individuals displaying potential augmentations, Report all suspected Technocrat activity to Command immediately, Avoid direct confrontation unless absolutely necessary.</p>
	<p>Note: While Technocrats may present themselves as revolutionaries with a cause, their capabilities and alliances render them a significant threat. Approach all interactions with extreme caution and prioritize containment or neutralization over negotiation.</p>
	<p>This information is classified. Dissemination beyond authorized personnel is prohibited.</p>

  <p style=color:brown>"Not much to say here. We've been losing troops everytime we cross swampland. We don't exactly know who. Numbers just seem to dwindle each time. Besides one oral testimony, we've got no clue. I'll send the transcript.</p>
  <p>CLASSIFIED TRANSMISSION: Hostile Force Identification Report</p>
  <p>Testimony by: U.S.R. Master Sergeant Jewelle [Timestamp: CLASSIFIED]</p>
  <p> JEWELLE: We have reason to believe they are hiding in the irradiated wastes, utilizing both the terrain and environmental hazards to their advantage.</p>
  <p>Our scouting soldiers encountered what we can only describe as "abominations." These entities launched gas canisters at our units—canisters that, upon release, caused immediate corrosion to the softer components of our environmental suits. The damage inflicted was slow, agonizing, and horrific to witness. Had the gas come into direct contact with our flesh, the consequences would have been far worse.</p>
  <p>The voices of these hostile entities, distorted and warped by the mist and the cover of the trees, were faint but clear. They shouted curses and blasphemies, their language laced with fanatical zeal. From what we could understand, they raged against our rejection of their so-called "creators" and their "gifts." Zealous madmen, as far as I’m concerned.</p>
  <p>[3.2s PAUSE]</p>
  <p>We suspect that the G.R. may be involved in some capacity, though this remains unconfirmed. The G.R. is known for their expertise in chemical warfare, but they have not previously shown the inclination to directly engage us—not yet, at least. Should we uncover any link between them and the abominations we encountered, rest assured, there will be serious consequences.</p>
  <p>Additional Report.</p>
  <p>There is little to report beyond this initial encounter. These abominations have not been sighted within any known civilizations, and we have no reason to believe they are organizing outside of their isolated zones.</p>
  <p>However, all personnel are advised to exercise extreme caution when navigating the waste. Abominations appear to prefer irradiated areas, so avoid such territories whenever possible. Should you hear any calls from the wastelands, do not respond—there is no one out there you know, and any such contact is almost certainly hostile.</p>
  <p style=color:cyan> I have reason to suspect this unknown hostile is the Cult of the Atom (COTA) as I've been able to personally  see a member myself. They arent hostile to the average person if you are truly just passing by. It seems their hostility-on-sight is restrictly towards anyone in Republic uniform.</p>
